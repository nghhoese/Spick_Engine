# Spick_Engine
A game engine made in c++ using sdl in facades similar to unity's structure
This was part of the minor system programming during the last year of my bachelors.
A project that took 5 months and 5 people. We also made a game that of course used our own engine that you can find here: https://github.com/nghhoese/Spick_Game
